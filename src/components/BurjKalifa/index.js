                    Dubai may be an international playground for global superstars, but no one can eclipse the biggest star of all, the Burj Khalifa.<br />
                    <br />
                    Located in thriving downtown Dubai, the needle-shaped super scraper takes center stage in the famed skyline with millions of visitors and VIPs flocking each year to arguably the most prestigious address in the world.<br />
                    <br />
                    The tallest manmade structure is the ultimate symbol of glitz, glamor and the over-the-top excess for which the city is known.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Burj by numbers
                    Soaring over the city at an impressive 2,716 feet (828 meters) and boasting 200 stories (160 habitable), the $1.5 billion Burj Khalifa project was unveiled by Dubai's ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum in January 2010.<br />
                    <br />
                    At the peak of construction, more than 12,000 international workers were on site per day logging a collective 22 million man-hours during the six years it took to complete.<br />
                    <br />
                    The Burj Khalifa is twice the height of New York's Empire State Building and three times as tall as the Eiffel Tower in Paris.<br />
                    <br />
                    Not content with being the tallest building in the world, the Burj Khalifa has also snagged a clutch of other bragging rights.
