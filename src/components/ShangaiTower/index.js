                    Standing at 2,073 ft, the Shanghai Tower, located in China, is the second tallest building in the world. The construction of this phenomenal skyscraper started in 1997, but it was put on hold several times due to funding issues.<br/>
                    <br />
                    The tower had the world's second-fastest elevator with a fantastic speed of 20.5 meters per second but it was soon surpassed by the Guangzhou CTF Finance Center in 2017 with its speed of about 21 meters per second.<br/>
                    <br />
                    The world's second tallest building, Shanghai Tower, was designed by the international firm Gensler and is owned by the Shanghai Municipal Government and is one of the most magnificent buildings in the world.<br/>
                    <br />
                    The tower is located in the financial district of Pudong and has 128 floors and up to 270 wind turbines. Formed with nine cylindrical buildings, each of the nine buildings or zones features gorgeous gardens, cafes, and some retail spaces. All nine zones are encased in a glass fa√ßade and form one structure.<br/>
                    <br />
                    Interesting Fact: While Burj Khalifa has bagged the title of the Tallest Building in the World, Shanghai Tower is the tallest building considering the height of usable floors.<br/>
