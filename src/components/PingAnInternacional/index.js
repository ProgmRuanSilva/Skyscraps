                    ompleted its construction in 2017, the Ping An International Finance Centre has been titled the tallest building in Shenzhen, the second tallest in China, and the fourth-tallest building in the world.<br />
                    <br />
                    The structure comprises about 100 office floors apart from a retail and a conference podium that can accommodate nearly 15,500 workers and around 9,000 passengers.<br />
                    <br />
                    This gorgeous infrastructure is designed by a New York-based architectural firm, Kohn Pedersen Fox Associates, which has also been credited with several other popular infrastructures in China, such as Shanghai World Financial Center and Chow Tai Fook Center.<br />
                    <br />
                    However, the structural design of the building was done by another firm named Thornton Tomasetti, based in New York.<br />
                    <br />
                    The estimated floor area of this massive tower is 378,600 sq. mts. If the space in the building's 11-story podium is also considered, then the building has a total of 495,520 sq. mts of area.<br />
