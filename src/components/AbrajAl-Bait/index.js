                    With 120 stories and 1,972 ft, the Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower has earned the title of the third tallest building in the world after Shanghai Tower in China.<br />
                    <br />
                    The construction work of Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower began in 2004 and took nearly six years to complete.<br />
                    <br />
                    Designed by the Lebanese architecture firm â€“ Dar Al-Handasah, this third-tallest building in the world is also known for being the most expensive building in the world, considering its construction cost, which is a whopping $15 billion.<br />
                    <br />
                    Sprawling across a colossal area of 1,500,000 m2, the building is also the largest building on the planet in terms of its floor area.<br />
                    <br />
                    Many people think of Big Ben as the largest clock; however, the clock on the London building is significantly smaller than the notable feature of the Abraj Al-Bait Clock Tower.<br />
                    <br />
                    It is the largest clock face in the world, with a dial on all four sides measuring 43 meters.<br />
                    <br />
                    Interesting Fact: The world's third tallest building, Abraj Al-Bait, sits on an old Ottoman fortress-destroyed land that overlooks some famous Islamic sites.<br />
                    <br />
                    The fortress destroyed to create new buildings was culturally significant to the Turkish people; thus, it created a minor diplomatic disturbance in 2002.<br />
