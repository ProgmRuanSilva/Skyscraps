                    Interesting Fact: One of the most interesting facts about the fifth tallest building in the world – Lotte World Tower, is that its construction was planned in the late 20th century.<br />
                    <br />
                    however, it took years to get the green light from the officials to build the building and eventually the construction work started in November 2010.<br />
